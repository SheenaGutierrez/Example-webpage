<h2>Need You Now</h2>
<p>Lady Antebellum</p>
</div>
<div align="center">
<p2><br>Picture perfect memories<br>Scattered all around the floor<br>
Reaching for the phone cause<br>I can't fight it anymore<br><br>
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind <br>
For me it happens all the time<br><br>
It's a quarter after one<br>
I'm all alone and I need you now<br>
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control<br>
And I need you now<br>
And I don't know how I can do without<br>
I just need you now<br><br>
Another shot of whisky<br>
Can't stop looking at the door<br>
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before<br>
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind<br>
For me it happens all the time<br><br>
It's a quarter after one<br>
I'm a little drunk and I need you now<br>
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control<br>
And I need you now<br>
And I don't know how I can do without<br><br>
I just need you now<br><br>
Guess I rather hurt than feel nothing at all<br><br>
It's a quarter after one<br>
I'm all alone and I need you now<br><br>
And I said I wouldn't call<br>
But I'm a little drunk and I need you now<br><br>
And I don't know how I can do without<br>
I just need you now<br>
I just need you now<br><br>
Oh, baby, I need you now
